So far you've seen some of the automation between issues, commits, builds that we provide out-of-the-box and now it's time to automate some of your own development workflow and actions. You're going to:

-   [**Develop and publish a new Atomist handler**](build-handler.md)
-   [**Convert an existing project to an Atomist generator**](build-generator.md)
