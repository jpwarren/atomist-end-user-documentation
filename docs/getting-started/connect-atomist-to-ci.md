Atomist can listen for CI events, correlate them with the commits that triggered the build, and show contextualized notifications in the Slack channel.

To enable this, we need to connect Atomist to your CI system. Atomist currently works with Travis CI and Jenkins. Use either the [Travis CI](#travis-ci-setup) or [Jenkins](#jenkins-setup) section to help you configure Atomist to connect with your CI.

### Travis CI Setup

Travis uses your GitHub user access token. Once you have set up Travis for your GitHub account, you are ready to go. No additional authorization required. If you have not yet setup Travis and want to as part of getting started with Atomist, please see the [Travis getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners) documentation.

!!! note ""
    Atomist works with Travis-CI.org and Travis-CI.com. Travis Enterprise is not currently supported.

You will need to enable your projects to be built using Travis if they aren't already set up. See the [Travis documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners) to set up Travis builds.

Next, configure your Travis builds to send notifications to Atomist. In the `.travis.yml` configuration file in the project repo, add the following webhook configuration.

```yaml
notifications:
  webhooks:
    urls:
    - https://webhook.atomist.com/travis
    on_success: always
    on_failure: always
    on_start: always
    on_cancel: always
    on_error: always
```

That's all that you need to do. Now, Travis will send all notifications to Atomist. To test it out, see the [CI Notifications](#in-action-ci-notifications) section.

### Jenkins Setup

!!! note ""
    Atomist requires the [Notification plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/notification) for Jenkins. The Notification plugin is what will send event notifications to Atomist, so that we can notify and take action based on build events.

If you don't already have the Notification plugin installed, go to the Plugin Manager in the Jenkins admin interface, select it and complete the installation.

  <img src="../images/jenkins-install-notification.png" alt="Install Notification Plugin" class="ss-medium">
</div>

To enable the plugin, be sure to restart Jenkins after installation.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/jenkins-install-notification-status-reboot.png" alt="Notification Plugin Installation Status" class="ss-medium">
</div>

Now that the Notification plugin is installed and enabled, it's time to configure project Notifications settings. Select a project that you would like Atomist to get events from. Next, select "Configure".

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/jenkins-configure-project.png" alt="Configure Project" class="ss-small">
</div>

We're going to walk through setting up a webhook. In the Job Notifications section of the project configuration, click the "Add Endpoint" button.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/jenkins-add-notification.png" alt="Add Notification" class="ss-medium">
</div>

In the Notification configuration section, configure the endpoint URL as `https://webhook.atomist.com/jenkins` and check that the other parameters match the information shown below.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/jenkins-webhook.png" alt="Configure Webhook" class="ss-medium">
</div>

Now, Jenkins is set up to send all notifications to Atomist. To test it out, see the next section, [In Action: CI Notifications](#in-action-ci-notifications).

### CI Notifications

Now that CI is also configured, let's take a look at how Atomist handles CI events.

Let's make a little change the `README.md` of our `sprockets` repo, then commit it.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/sprockets-readme-edit.png" alt="Edit README" class="ss-small">
</div>

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/sprockets-readme-commit.png" alt="Commit README" class="ss-large">
</div>

This project is configured so that the commit triggers a Travis build. Atomist is now receiving CI notifications, and is notified of the build started.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/sprockets-commit-notification.png" alt="Commit Notification" class="ss-small">
</div>
