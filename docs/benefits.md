# The Many Benefits of Using Atomist

What's in it for me? We're glad you asked.

## A Robot Helper

<img style="float:right; margin-top:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px;" src="/images/atomist-bot-color.jpg" width="150px" height="150px" alt="Your friendly, neighborhood Atomist Bot"/>

The `@atomist` bot works like a developer on your team, but with a few important
differences:
- `@atomist` doesn't get bored doing tedious, repetitive work.
- `@atomist` doesn't accidentally miss steps or make typos.
- `@atomist` is faster than you.

With `@atomist` working on your team, you have a robot helper who is only too eager
to take care of all the tasks that are necessary, but tedious. It's what automation
is all about!

Get a robot helper to do the boring parts of your job for you, and you can concentrate
on the interesting and fun stuff.

## Tying It All Together

For all the automation we have today, a lot of the tasks in development are
pretty repetitive. Setting up a new project, merging new code and retesting,
tracking down which code broke the build, etc.

There are plenty of tools like Puppet, Chef, or Kubernetes for automating the
*infrastructure* and *operations* of an environment, but they don't really understand
*code*.

Atomist does.

Atomist automates code, which means you can use Atomist with all your existing
tools&mdash;including Puppet, Chef, or Kubernetes&mdash; by plugging Atomist
into their config files, because it's all just code.

Atomist makes everything you already have *even better* by integrating with
your tools and automating common tasks.

with bundled rugs.

## Save Time And Hassle

You could develop your own automation suite, sure. But not by tomorrow. You don't
write your own IDE or compiler, you just use one.

Atomist has already done all the hard work of building the tool, so you don't have to.

Same time and hassle and use what works.

## More Than Templates

Templates are one way we've tried in the past to automate things. Just create
a perfect, golden image, and that's what we'll use for new projects. The
trouble with templates is that they don't tend to get updated with the changes
we make to actual, running projects. It takes tremendous discipline to manually
update templates to reflect the new, better way to do things.

Worse, creating the templates requires stripping out all the working, functional
code to create a bare, generic archetype. The generic nature of the code means that
we end up having to change a lot of it in order to take it from a template to
actual running code. We're putting back all of the stuff that we took out to
make the template in the first place!

Instead of that, Atomist takes existing, running code and changes it into other,
also running, code. Every running project can be a template for a new one, and you
only have to change the pieces that you need to.
