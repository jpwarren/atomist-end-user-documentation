Rug extensions represent different types of source code, events, and
systems which Rug can understand and interact with.  Each Rug
extension defines a set of operations you can use to get and
modify the system or language it represents.

Rug ships with a number of extensions for basic concepts around
projects, file systems, and common languages, making it *much* simpler
to begin writing your Rugs.  More information on the various
extensions that ship with Rug and the methods they make available can
be found in the extension reference documentation
for [projects][project-typedoc] and [handlers][handler-typedoc].  Here
are some of extensions that ship with Rug that are useful when working
with projects:

[project-typedoc]: http://apidocs.atomist.com/typedoc/rug/
[handler-typedoc]: http://apidocs.atomist.com/typedoc/cortex/

You can also write your own Rug extensions.
