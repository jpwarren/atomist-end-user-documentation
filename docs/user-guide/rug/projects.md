A key design goal for Rug was to respect your own tooling as much as
possible so that *every project could be a working Atomist project,
and every Atomist project remains a working project*.  Therefore,
Atomist files reside unobtrusively within your existing projects.
Specifically, Atomist files reside in a directory named `.atomist` at
the root of your project's source code hierarchy.  Any project that
has a `.atomist` directory at its root with a valid `manifest.yml`.

## The `.atomist` directory

A typical Rug project will have a `.atomist` directory that looks
something like the following.

```console
.atomist
├── build/
├── editors/
├── generators/
├── handlers/
├── manifest.yml
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── reviewers/
├── target/
├── templates/
├── tests/
└── tsconfig.json
```

The only required file in the `.atomist` directory is the
`manifest.yml`.  The table below explains each entry.

Entry | Description
------|------------
`build` | contains CI build scripts and configuration
`editors` | contains Rug editors
`generators` | contains Rug generators
`handlers` | contains Rug command and event handlers
`manifest.yml` | Rug archive metadata and dependencies declarations, *required*
`node_modules` | contains source code for TypeScript typings and dependencies installed by [NPM][npm]
`package.json` | standard NPM `package.json` file declaring the TypeScript dependencies
`reviewers` | contains Rug reviewers
`target` | contains files generated by the Rug CLI during building and packaging
`templates` | contains templates used by Rugs
`tests` | contains Rug tests
`tsconfig.json` | TypeScript compiler options useful for IDE TypeScript tooling

!!! note ""
    The `tsconfig.json` is *not* used by the Rug CLI when compiling TypeScript.

## Metadata

The `.atomist/manifest.yml` file contains the Rug archive project
metadata.  The `manifest.yml` file is a standard [YAML][yaml] file.
Typical contents for the `manifest.yml` will look like:

[yaml]: http://yaml.org/

```yaml
artifact: rug-editors
group: atomist-rugs
version: "0.15.0"
requires: "[0.12.0,1.0.0)"
dependencies:
extensions:
```

Key | Value
----|------
`#!yaml artifact` | unqualified name of the Rug archive
`#!yaml group` | group of the Rug archive, typically the same as the GitHub owner
`#!yaml version` | [semantic version][semver] of the Rug archive
`#!yaml requires` | version(s) of `rug` this Rug archive is compatible with
`#!yaml dependencies` | a sequence of other, fully-qualified Rug archives on which this Rug archive depends
`#!yaml extensions` | a sequence of Rug extensions (JVM JARs) on which this Rug archive depends

[semver]: http://semver.org/

## Dependencies

A Rug project can have four different types of dependencies:

1.  Rug runtime dependency
2.  Other Rug archives
3.  Rug extensions
5.  TypeScript types

### Runtime

The Rug runtime dependency is specified using the `requires` key in
the `manifest.yml`.  The value of the `requires` key is a string that
specifies either an exact Rug runtime version or a version range using
the Maven [version range][mvn-ver-range].  The following would cause
the Rugs in the project to only executed by Rug runtime version
0.13.0.

[mvn-ver-range]: https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.htmlp

```yaml
requires: "0.13.0"
```

In contrast, the following specification could run under any version
of the Rug runtime from 0.13.0, inclusive, up to, but not including,
version 1.0.0.

```yaml
requires: "[0.13.0, 1.0.0)"
```

When deciding on which version to use, the highest available version
satisfying the range constraints will be used.

### Archives

Rugs in one project can call Rugs in other archives as long as the
calling Rug's project declares a dependency on the archive of the Rug
being called.  Dependencies on other Rug archives are declared by
listing the fully-qualified name of the Rug archive containing the Rug
being called as an entry in the sequence value of the `dependencies`
key.  The fully-qualified name of a Rug archive is archive group and
artifact name joined by a colon (`:`).  You can optionally specify the
version of the Rug archive dependency by appending a colon and the
version to the full-qualified name.  Here is an example of a
dependency on a specific Rug archive version.

```yaml
dependencies:
  - atomist-rugs:rug-editors:0.14.0
```

### Extensions

Rugs in a project can use Rug extensions not in the Rug core if they
declare a dependency on the extension.  A dependency on a Rug
extension is declared by listing the fully-qualified name of the Rug
extension as an entry in the sequence value of the `extensions` key.
The fully-qualified name of the extension is comprised of the group ID
and artifact ID joined by a colon (`:`).  You can optionally specify
the version of the Rug extension dependency by appending a colon and
the version to the full-qualified name.  Here is an example of a
specific-version extension dependency.

```yaml
extensions:
  - com.atomist:travis-rug-extension:0.9.1
```

### TypeScript types

While developing Rugs, and to fully benefit from the static typing
support of the TypeScript language, your project should declare a
dependency on an appropriate version of the Rug TypeScript typings in
`.atomist/package.json`.  The `package.json` file is a
standard [Node package file][npmpackage].  You only need to specify
the `dependencies` section to the minimum released version of the Rug
language your project targets.  Below are the complete contents of a
valid `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@atomist/rug": "0.13.0"
  }
}
```

[npmpackage]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json

!!! note ""
    The `.atomist/package.json` file does not impact the runtime of
    your Rug, which is driven by the value of the `requires` key in
    `.atomist/manifest.yml`.  The former only exists to support a nice
    development experience from your favorite IDE or editor.

## Basic Rug Project

A very basic Rug project can be generated using
the [Rug project generator][rug-generator].  Instructions running the
generator using the Rug CLI can be found in the project's README.
