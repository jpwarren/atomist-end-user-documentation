A Rug archive is a packaged version of a project that contains Rugs.
Rug archives are created using the `rug install` CLI command.  A Rug
archive contains all of the source code from the original project, the
necessary parts of the project's `.atomist` directory, and archive
metadata, based on the contents of the project's
`.atomist/manifest.yml` file.  See [Rug project][project] for more
details on the contents of the `.atomist` directory and `manifest.yml`
file.
