# A Day in the Life of a Rug Project

This page describes the nature, structure and lifecycle of a Rug
project.

If you haven't done so and you want to follow along, please [install
the Rug CLI][install].

[install]: http://docs.atomist.com/rug/cli/rug-cli-install/

## Inception

The easiest way to create a new Rug project is by using the
`NewStarterRugProject` generator via the Bot or CLI. Here, we'll show
how to do it with the CLI.

```console
$ rug generate atomist-rugs:rug-editors:NewStarterRugProject my-rug-project
Resolving dependencies for atomist-rugs:rug-editors (latest·zip) completed

Successfully generated new project my-rug-project
```

That command created a new directory named `my-rug-project` in the
current directory, `~/develop` in this case.

## Structure

The created Rug project has the following directory structure:

```console
$ tree -a my-rug-project
my-rug-project/
├── .atomist
│   ├── editors
│   │   └── MyFirstEditor.ts
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── manifest.yml
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tests
│   │   └── project
│   │       ├── MyFirstEditorTest.feature
│   │       └── MyFirstEditorTest.ts
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── .atomist.yml
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

The editor `MyFirstEditor.ts` and corresponding test `MyFirstEditorTest.feature`
have been generated when running the generate command.

Let's take a look at the `manifest.yml`:

```console
$ cd my-rug-project/.atomist
$ cat manifest.yml
group: "atomist-rugs"
artifact: "my-rug-project"
version: "0.1.0"
requires: "[0.17.3,1.0.0)"
```

The `manifest.yml` specifies the unique coordinates of the Rug archive: its
group, name and version. Dependencies and extensions may also be declared:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `group` | The group of the Rug archive, should be the GitHub org |
| `artifact` | A unique identifier within the `group`, should be the GitHub repository name |
| `version` | Version of the Rug archive |
| `requires` | The rug-lib version this project is being developed with. Version range is allowed |
| `dependencies` | List of project dependencies in form group:artifact:version. Version ranges are allowed |
| `extensions` | List of binary dependencies, e.g., Rug Extension types. Version ranges are allowed |

## Running Tests

After making changes to your Rug code, you should run the tests.  The
generated Rug project already has some tests.

```console
$ rug test

## Installing

To package the Rug project up and make it available to the Rug CLI to
run from any directory, you must install it:

```console
$ rug install

Successfully installed archive for atomist-rugs:my-rug-project (0.1.0)

```

The `install` command takes the project, packages it up for
distribution, and installs it under `~/.atomist/repository`.

The contents of the archive can be further tuned by adding entries to
`.atomist/.gitignore`, the packaging step considers the contents of these files
when creating the archive.

## Publishing

Publishing is the process of uploading an archive to a Maven
repository so it can only be used by others.  Before publishing a Rug
archive, you first need to configure a publishing repository in your
`~/.atomst/cli.yml`.  You must have write permission to this
repository, set the `publish` field to `true`, and you will typically
have to supply authentication information.  For example, if you have
the environment variables `MAVEN_BASE_URL`, `MAVEN_USER`, and
`MAVEN_TOKEN` set appropriate for your Maven repository, you would use
the following configuration in your `~/.atomist/cli.yml`:

```yaml
remote-repositories:
  rugs-release:
    publish: true
    url: "${MAVEN_BASE_URL}/rugs-release"
    authentication:
      username: "${MAVEN_USER}"
      password: "${MAVEN_TOKEN}"
```

Once you have your publishing repository configured, you simply run
`rug publish`.

```console
$ rug publish
