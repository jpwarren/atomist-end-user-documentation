The Rug CLI gives you the tooling to develop, test, and publish your
own Rugs.

## Additional Dependencies

Rugs are implemented in [TypeScript][ts] and it is recommended you
install [npm][npm].  You should also get an [IDE/editor][editor] with
good support for TypeScript language.

[ts]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
[editor]: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support

## Quick CLI Tour

### Get some Rugs

To generate and edit code with Rug automation, you should become
familiar with Rug editors, generators, and reviewers.  The best way to
do that is to look at some examples.  Some simple examples of Rug
editors can be found in the [common-editors][common] repo.  You can
clone that repo with the following command.

[common]: https://github.com/atomist-rugs/common-editors

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/atomist-rugs/common-editors.git
$ cd common-editors
$ ls -1F
CHANGELOG.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
LICENSE
README.md
src/
```

You cloned the repo, but where are the Rugs?  Rugs are always located
in the `.atomist` directory at the top level of the project, i.e., the
same directory that has the `.git` directory.

```console
$ ls -1F .atomist/
build/
editors/
manifest.yml
target/
templates/
tests/
```

Here you can see the standard layout for a Rug directory.  It has a
`manifest.yml` describing the contents of the project.  Think of this
as the metadata for your Rugs, i.e., the name, version, dependencies,
etc.  The editors and generators are in the `editors` directory.  Any
templates are in the `templates` directory.  Testing is integral to
Rug, so we also use a `tests` directory to hold all our tests.  There
is also a `build` directory that contains the repository's CI scripts
and configurations.

Let's see what editors we have available.

```console
$ awk '$1 == "editor" { print $2 }' .atomist/editors/*.rug
AddApacheSoftwareLicense20
AddChangeLog
AddReadme
AddScalaMavenGitIgnore
ClassRenamer
PackageMove
PomParameterizer
RemoveApacheSoftwareLicense20
RemoveChangeLog
RemoveCodeOfConduct
```

Feel free to look around in the `.atomist` directory to see what is
there, investigate the Rug syntax, and see what the tests look like.

### Test those Rugs

It is a best practice to provide tests for your Rugs.  The first Rug
command we are going to try will run all of the tests available in the
common-editors repo.

```console
$ rug test

```

The above command will download all the dependencies needed to run the
editors defined in the common-editors repo.  Depending on the speed of
your network connection, this may take some time.  Each dependency
only need be downloaded once, so subsequent executions of `rug` will
be faster.

As you can see from the last line of output, all of the test scenarios
passed.

To run a specific named test:

```console
$ rug test "Whatever Test Secanrio"
```

To run all scenarios from a single test file:

```console
$ rug test MyRugTestFilename
```

### Make your Rugs Available

The next step is to create a Rug archive and install it locally so you
can use it on local projects.  This is accomplished with the `install`
command.

```console
$ rug install
Resolving dependencies for atomist-rugs:common-editors:0.7.0 ← local completed
Loading atomist-rugs:common-editors:0.7.0 ← local into runtime completed

→ Contents
  ├─┬ .atomist
...

Successfully installed archive for atomist-rugs:common-editors:0.7.0
```

This command packages up all of the Rugs in the `.atomist` directory
and installs them in your local repository, typically
`~/.atomist/repository`.

### List the installed Editors

Remember above when we ran that arcane `awk` command to list the
editors?  There is a better way!  Now that we some editors installed
locally, we can list our local editors.

```console
$ rug list
Resolving dependencies for com.atomist:rug:0.8.0 completed
Listing local archives completed

→ Local Archives
  atomist-rugs:common-editors (0.7.0)

For more information on specific archive version, run:
  rug describe archive ARCHIVE -a VERSION
```

Looks like the Rug Archive we installed is indeed installed.  That
last line of the output tells us how we can get more information.
Let's try that command.  Since we only have one version available, we
can omit the `-a` command-line option.  When it is not provided, the
latest version is used.

```console
$ rug describe archive atomist-rugs:common-editors
Processing dependencies
  Downloading atomist-rugs/common-editors/maven-metadata.xml ← rugs (0kb) succeeded
Resolving dependencies for atomist-rugs:common-editors:latest completed

  AddReadme (adds a project specific README)
  AddScalaMavenGitIgnore (adds a .gitignore suitable for Scala Maven projects)
  ClassRenamer (renames a Java class, replacing one literal pattern with another)
  PackageMove (renames a Java package)
  PomParameterizer (updates a Maven pom to a new group, artifact, version and description)
  RemoveApacheSoftwareLicense20 (removes an Apache Software License version 2.0 file if present)
  RemoveChangeLog (removes CHANGELOG file if present)
  RemoveCodeOfConduct (removes CODE_OF_CONDUCT file if present)

→ Requires
  [0.8.0,1.0.0)

To get more information on any of the Rugs listed above, run:
  rug describe editor|generator|executor|reviewer ARTIFACT
```

That list of editors looks familiar, we must be doing something right!
Again, the last line of the output tells us how we can get more
information.  Let's try it.

```console
$ rug describe editor AddApacheSoftwareLicense20

No valid ARTIFACT provided, no default artifact defined and not in local mode.

Run the following command for usage help:
  rug describe --help.
```

Hmm, looks like something went wrong.  Fortunately the error tells us
we either need to define a default artifact or run in local mode.  How
do we run in local mode?  The above output tells us to run `rug
describe --help` for usage help.  Let's do it.

```console
$ rug describe --help
Usage: rug describe [OPTION]... TYPE ARTIFACT
Print details about an archive or Rug.

Options:
  -?,-h,--help          Print help information
  -X,--error            Print verbose error messages
  -o,--offline          Use only downloaded archives
  -q,--quiet            Do not display progress messages
  -r,--resolver-report  Print dependency tree
  -s,--settings FILE    Use settings file FILE
  -t,--timer            Print timing information
  -u,--update           Update dependency resolution

Command Options:
  -a,--archive-version AV  Use archive version AV
  -l,--local               Use local working directory as archive

TYPE should be 'editor', 'generator', 'executor', 'reviewer' or
'archive' and ARTIFACT should be the full name of an artifact, e.g.,
"atomist:spring-service:Spring Microservice".  If the name of the
artifact has spaces in it, you need to put quotes around it.

Please report issues at https://github.com/atomist/rug-cli
```

The help output provides two pieces of information useful to us.
First, it says the `ARTIFACT` should be the full name of the artifact.
We only provided the editor name.  Perhaps we needed to prepend the
archive name.  Second, the `-l` or `--local` command-line option tells
the CLI to use the current directory as an archive.  In other words,
it tries to find an `.atomist` directory and use the Rugs in it.
Since we are in a directory that has the `.atomist` directory with the
editor we want to run, that seems promising.

```console
$ rug describe -l editor AddApacheSoftwareLicense20
Resolving dependencies for atomist-rugs:common-editors:0.7.0 ← local completed
Loading atomist-rugs:common-editors:0.7.0 ← local into runtime completed

AddApacheSoftwareLicense20
atomist-rugs:common-editors:0.7.0
add the Apache Software License version 2.0 file

→ Tags
  apache (apache)
  license (license)
  documentation (documentation)
→ Parameters
  no parameters needed

To invoke the AddApacheSoftwareLicense20 editor, run:
  rug edit "atomist-rugs:common-editors:AddApacheSoftwareLicense20" -a 0.7.0 -l
```

Success!  The output from that command also tells us what the full
name of the editor is,
`atomist-rugs:common-editors:AddApacheSoftwareLicense20`.  We could
have guessed that.  Since we previously installed the editor, we could
have run the following command and gotten the same result.

```console
$ rug describe editor atomist-rugs:common-editors:AddApacheSoftwareLicense20
```

The `describe editor` output includes several pieces of useful
information.  The description, "adds the Apache Software License
version 2.0 file", provides a slightly more verbose description than
the already descriptive editor name.  We can see that this editor has
three tags, `license`, `apache`, and `documentation`, and it takes no
parameters.

Adding the Apache license seems like a good thing to do.  The last
line of the output once again gives us the information we need: how to
run this editor.  Let's try it.

### Run an Editor

We will just run the command we were provided above.  We remove the
`-l` since, having installed the archive, we do not need to run it
from the local directory, we can run it from the installed archive.

```console
$ rug edit atomist-rugs:common-editors:AddApacheSoftwareLicense20 -a 0.7.0
Resolving dependencies for atomist-rugs:common-editors:latest completed
Loading atomist-rugs:common-editors:0.7.0 into runtime completed

→ Changes
  ├── LICENSE created 11kb
  └── .atomist.yml created 3kb

Successfully edited project common-editors
```

Looks like two files were edited in the local repository.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   .atomist.yml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Hmm, git shows only one file has been modified.  Why?  Well, the
contents of the `LICENSE` file were set to be the Apache Software
License, but that is what the contents already were.  Git is smart.
What is that `atomist.yml` file?

```console
$ cat .atomist.yml
---
kind: "operation"
client: "rug-cli 0.20.0"
editor:
  name: "atomist-rugs.common-editors.AddApacheSoftwareLicense20"
  group: "atomist-rugs"
  artifact: "common-editors"
  version: "0.7.0"
  origin:
    repo: "atomist-rugs/common-editors.git"
    branch: "master"
    sha: "622ed10"

```

Looks like it is a record of what we have done, nice!

I suppose we should have guessed the editor would act on the local
directory, but we don't really want to edit the current project.
Let's create another project to edit.  We run the same command as
above, except we'll remove the archive version command-line option.
If you do not provide the `-a` option, the CLI will use the latest
installed version, 0.7.0 in our case.

```console
$ cd ..
$ mkdir atomist-test
$ cd !$
$ git init
$ rug edit atomist-rugs:common-editors:AddApacheSoftwareLicense20

That's more like it!  What if we decide we do not want the Apache
Software License?  There's an editor for that!

```console
