Atomist integrates with and automates activities over various tools
and services in your development tool chain.  To do so, certain
permission are needed.  Atomist only asks for permissions required to
accomplish its work.

Please see the individual sections for specifics on the permissions
requested by Atomist.

*   [Slack OAuth Scopes](slack.md)
*   [GitHub OAuth Scopes](github.md)

If you still have questions about permissions, please contact us in
our [Atomist Community slack team](https://join.atomist.com) or email
us at [support@atomist.com](mailto:support@atomist.com).
