Welcome to the Atomist User Guide.

If you are not familiar with Atomist, you may want to start with
the [Atomist Overview][overview].  If you do not have Atomist set up
in Slack, you may want to go through
the [Getting Started][getting-started] guide.

-   [**Interfaces**][interfaces]: How users interact with Atomist
