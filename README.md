# Atomist 'end-user-documentation'

[![Slack Status](https://join.atomist.com/badge.svg)](https://join.atomist.com/)

This repository contains the markdown sources for the documentation
for [Atomist][atomist].  You can find the current version of the
Atomist documentation at [http://docs.atomist.com/][docs].

[atomist]: https://www.atomist.com/
[docs]: http://docs.atomist.com/

The documentation is generated from markdown using [mkdocs][].

[mkdocs]: http://www.mkdocs.org/

## Editing

Much of the documentation is hand-generated, so you can feel free to
edit.

The exception is the
auto-generated [reference documentation](docs/reference/).  The aim is
for all of the reference documentation to be auto-generated.  At
present, the [Rug][rug] and [Rug CLI][cli] reference documentation are
auto-generated during their builds.  The Rug reference docs are
automatically published to http://apidocs.atomist.com.  The Rug CLI
documentation must be copied into this repo at
`docs/reference/rug-cli/index.md`.

[cli]: https://github.com/atomist/rug-cli

## Styles

We use the [Admonition][admonition] extension.  Here are the available
admonition styles.

## Releasing

When a push is made to this repository, the entire documentation is
built again via a [Travis][travis] job and published to
http://atomist.github.io/end-user-documentation/ .

[travis]: https://travis-ci.com/atomisthq/end-user-documentation

If the build is triggered by a tag of the form `M.N.P`, the site will
be pushed to the [Atomist GitHub Pages][pages] repository and served
by GitHub at http://atomisthq.github.io and https://docs.atomist.com .

## Build and serve the documentation locally

Generally speaking, you probably do not need to do anything
with this repository aside from pushing markdown content.

However, if you want to make a change to the HTML template
or serve the doc locally before a push, you should follow the
next steps to gear up properly your environment.

First [install Python](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Homebrew-and-Python.md)

```
$ brew install python3
```
or

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3
$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python3.5 get-pip.py
```

Then create a virtual environment to host the dependencies:

```
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ mkdir ~/.venvs
$ echo "export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ virtualenv -p `which python3` ~/.venvs/userdocs
```

Every time you want to work on this repository,
you shall activate that virtualenv in your terminal:

```
$ source ~/.venvs/userdocs/bin/activate
```

Now that the virtual environment is created, we can
install the dependencies into it:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ ( cd rug_pygments && python setup.py install )
```

You can now serve the documentation locally by running:

```
$ mkdocs serve
```

If all goes well, you can browse the documentation at
http://127.0.0.1:8000 .

You can publish the docs manually from your local repository with the
following command:

```
$ rm docs/CNAME && mkdocs gh-deploy && git checkout docs/CNAME
```
